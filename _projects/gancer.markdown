description: Knowledge-based planning (KBP) prediction models estimate the dose of radiation to be delivered to cancer patients using patient features. We proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN) to predict the entire 3-D dose distribution from contoured CT images. Experiments on a clinical data set of head-and-neck cancer patients showed that our GAN-based approach significantly outperformed prior deep learning and classical machine learning methods when evaluated on clinical satisfaction criteria.

KBP prediction models typically estimate low-dimensional summary statistics of a high-dimensional dose distribution. We proposed and implemented a generative adversarial network (GAN) to predict the entire 3-D dose distribution from contoured CT images. We performed experiments on a clinical data set of head-and-neck cancer patients to show that GAN-based approaches significantly outperform other deep learning and classical machine learning methods when evaluated on clinical satisfaction criteria.

The code is based on the CycleGAN-and-pix2pix codebase and is available on my Github. We have several associated publications and submitted work in MLHC 2018, NeurIPS ML4H 2018, and Medical Physics.
