title: Machine Learning for Contextual Decision-making 
description: In contextual prescriptive modeling, different context features personalize specific instances of a common decision-making problem. For example, treatment design must be personalized to meet the requirements of individual patients. Using data on historical contexts and decisions, we can develop sophisticated predictive models that estimate the effect of the context on the decision-making problem in order to automatically personalize the prescriptive model.
