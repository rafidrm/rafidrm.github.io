title: Managing Data for Machine Learning 
description: Data-centric machine learning calls for intelligently obtaining the best possible data for training a model. Data-centric practices can significantly reduce the financial, labor, and time costs of designing, training, and deploying AI systems in the wild. This research proposes operations-based approaches to data-centric modeling by optimizing what data to collect, synthesize, and label for building ML models.
