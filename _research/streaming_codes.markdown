title: Real-Time Algebraic Error Correction Coding 
description: In real-time Internet streaming, data packets are encoded with error correction in order to protect against transmission failures and missing bits. This problem is classically modeled as a stochastic system connecting a single transmitter and receiver. However, the Internet in reality is a network where information flows through multiple nodes before reaching an intended receiver. In my Masters research, I developed a series of algebraic error correction codes for real-time streaming communication over networks of nodes along with information-theoretic proofs guaranteeing the optimality of these codes.
