title: Error Correction Coding for Real-Time Multimedia Communication 
description: In real-time Internet streaming, data packets are encoded with error correction to protect against transmission failures as they flow through nodes in a network. This research introduces a series of error correction coding algorithms for real-time multimedia that ensures the data is resilient to the types of error patterns typically found in Internet streaming. I am no longer active in this area.
