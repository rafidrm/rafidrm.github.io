title: Data-driven Personalized Healthcare 
description: The combination of machine learning and data-driven optimization can be used in several healthcare applications to improve factors such as effectiveness, quality of care and service, and access to treatment. Problems in these domains often require predictinve analytics to estimate relevant problem characteristics which are used to fuel a decision-making model. In my research, I have worked on personalized treatment, e.g., design of radiation therapy treatments for head-and-neck cancer, estimating degree of hearing loss and post-operative effects of hearing aids, as well as healthcare management, e.g., data-driven batching in milk-banks.
