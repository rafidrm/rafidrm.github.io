I am a Postgraduate Researcher with NVIDIA AI. I recently completed my PhD at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, before which I completed my MASc and BASc at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, all at the University of Toronto. 


My research interests span deep learning, data-driven optimization, and information theory. I have applied my research towards personalized healthcare, portfolio optimization, and real-time error correction codes. Outside of research, I have also worked on sports analytics and quantitative finance.


I am also an avid traveller. In 2017, I completed a personal milestone of traveling to every continent (not including Antarctica). My current wish list of future destinations include Azerbaijan and South Africa.
