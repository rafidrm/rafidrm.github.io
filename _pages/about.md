I am an AI Resident Researcher at the NVIDIA Toronto AI Lab. I completed my PhD in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and my MASc and BASc in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, all at the University of Toronto. 


My research interests involve deep learning and data-driven optimization for solving problems in prescriptive analytics. This research covers applications in personalized medicine, clinic operations, and portfolio optimization. Outside of research, I have also worked on problems in sports analytics and quantitative finance.


Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I was an avid traveller. In 2017, I completed a personal milestone of traveling to every continent (not including Antarctica). My current goal of future destinations include Azerbaijan and South Africa.
