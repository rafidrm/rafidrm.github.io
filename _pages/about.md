I am an Assistant Professor at the [Telfer School of Management](https://telfer.uottawa.ca/en/) in the University of Ottawa. 
I am also a part-time Sr. Research Scientist at the [NVIDIA Toronto AI Lab](https://nv-tlabs.github.io).



I am interested in the operational challenges behind the deployment and use of AI systems.
I use deep learning and data-driven optimization for problems where the typical forms of large-scale data collection and model tuning are prohibitive. 
My work addresses ML technology (e.g., [computer vision systems](https://nv-tlabs.github.io/LearnOptimizeCollect/)), healthcare (e.g., [personalized medicine](https://www.aapm.org/GrandChallenge/OpenKBP/)), and finance (e.g., [portfolio optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09293.pdf)). 
I am also interested in general data science problems (e.g., [sports analytics](https://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/orms.2021.05.29/full://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/orms.2021.05.29/full/)).

**Students interested in (Undergraduate/Masters/PhD) supervision at Telfer are welcome to [contact me here](mailto:mahmood@telfer.uottawa.ca) with a CV and transcript.**

**Graduate students interested in internships at NVIDIA are welcome to [contact me here](mailto:rmahmood@nvidia.com) with a CV and summary of research interests.**

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I was an avid traveller. In 2017, I completed a personal milestone of traveling to every continent (not including Antarctica). My current goal of future destinations include Azerbaijan and South Africa.
