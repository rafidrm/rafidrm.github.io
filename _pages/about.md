I am a Sr. Research Scientist at the [NVIDIA Toronto AI Lab](https://nv-tlabs.github.io).
I completed my PhD in [Industrial Engineering](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca) and my MASc and BASc in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), all at the University of Toronto. 



I am interested in the operational challenges behind the deployment and use of AI systems.
I use deep learning and data-driven optimization for problems where the typical forms of large-scale data collection and model tuning are prohibitive. 
My work addresses ML technology (e.g., computer vision systems), healthcare (e.g., personalized medicine, clinic workflows), and finance (e.g., portfolio optimization). 
I am also generally interested in data science problems (e.g., sports analytics)



Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I was an avid traveller. In 2017, I completed a personal milestone of traveling to every continent (not including Antarctica). My current goal of future destinations include Azerbaijan and South Africa.
