I am an AI Resident Researcher at the NVIDIA Toronto AI Lab. I completed my PhD at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering and my MASc and BASc at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, all at the University of Toronto. 


My research interests span deep learning and data-driven optimization for prescriptive analytics. My work has explored automating decision-making problems in personalized treatment, clinical operations, and portfolio optimization. Outside of research, I have also worked on sports analytics and quantitative finance.


I am also an avid traveller. In 2017, I completed a personal milestone of traveling to every continent (not including Antarctica). My current wish list of future destinations include Azerbaijan and South Africa.
